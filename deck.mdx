Them UI

---

# PROPS

- simplicity
- theming
- primitive elements
- fast prototyping

---

# CONS

...

---

# Shorthands

- m, mx, my, p, px, py...
- margin, margin-left/margin-right, ...
- pure css also have shorthands like `flex: <grow> <shrink> <basis>`, `padding: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>`
- something developer needs to learn, but once he is familiar with the syntax it really speed up development

# sx prop

- how to use it
- what to avoid
- when creating new styled component put it after `{...rest}` (explain why!)

- when and why to use it
- export to normal CSS

# __css prop

# Dynamic props

- don't use `css` or `sx` for props that are constantly changing (animations on user interaction), use native `style` prop
- example:
  - transitioning `x` value form `0` to `n` with JS (react-spring) and passing it to css method `` (x) => css`transform: translateX(${x}px)`; `` will create `n` css classes like `css-XXXXXX`
  - this will hurt the performance
  - better use `` <div style={{ transform: `translateX(${x}px)` }} /> ``
  - this is not a problem with CSS-IN-JS, you'll use `style` prop in vanilla js and css, why you think CSS-IN-JS is different
  - problem is that developers don't think!
